<p>Different artist performances are scheduled at all ticket rates. It may happen that your performance location is away from our location or the artist you wish to hire is currently out of station/state. In this case, a separate fee will be applicable on your selected presentation.</p>



<p>This fee includes the following expenses: </p>



<ol class="is-style-checkbox"><li>Vehicle fee.</li><li>Due to the distance of travel time, all the expenses along the way are substantial, which includes auto/bus/cab/refreshment etc.</li><li>Each artist has its own separate principle and requirement under the presentation, hence its personal fee.</li></ol>

<p>Try to make sure all your guests/viewers sit in a row in a row. Remember that any artist&#8217;s performance requires a good music system and mic, so whether your event is small or large, the music system and mic must be good. Always provide a clean and elevated place for the artist to perform. Make sure that the artist has got all the things as per his requirement like table, chair, water bottle and other necessary material. Try not to have any other activities like food stalls, children&#8217;s play swings etc. in the party place where the performance is to be held. Due to this, the attention of the audience is not created properly and the artist may have to struggle a lot in the gathering.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-text-color-color has-css-opacity has-text-color-background-color has-background is-style-wide"/>



<p>If your close family members and friends actively engage with the artist during the performance, then your event can be a blast. No artist can add color by trying alone unless the guest/audience wants to engage openly. All the artists of Kohinoor Magic Show are experienced so if you provide them with the best facilities and atmosphere they will leave no stone unturned to add beauty to your celebrations. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-text-color-color has-css-opacity has-text-color-background-color has-background is-style-wide"/>



<p>During the ongoing programs, some small children and some elders also start spoiling the show by climbing on the stage. Therefore, explain them well that they should not do this and always stay in front of the stage and not on the stage and left and right. Every artist performs thinking that all the guests who come to your place will remember your wonderful Successful Party forever, for this, by giving a separate tip to the artist, definitely boost his/her morale. So that through various arts we can provide healthy and family entertainment to everyone in our country India.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-text-color-color has-css-opacity has-text-color-background-color has-background is-style-wide"/>



<p>Please note that we use very expensive and rare equipment during our presentation, so be sure to ask the artist that our equipment is safe or not.</p>
